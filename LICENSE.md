Well, I don't really know what to put here

Most of the work in these files are snippnets I've picked over the years from different people for my personal use.
I don't have the least idea on who are their authors. If you want to know who does it come from, please Google.

Only an important part of bashrc and bash_profile are really mine, speciall everything to do with colors and PS1

For what's mine the work is fully in Public Domain.
